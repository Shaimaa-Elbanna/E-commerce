## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

├── src
│ ├── components
│ │ ├── Cart.js
│ │ ├── Navbar.js
│ │ ├── Product.js

│ ├── pages
│ │ └── Home.js
│ ├── utils
│ │ └── localStorage.js
│ ├── App.js
│ ├── index.js
│ └── index.css
└── README.md


- The `components` folder contains reusable components used throughout the application, such as `Cart`, `Navbar`, `Product`, and `ProductList`.
- The `pages` folder includes individual pages of the website, such as `Home`.
- The `utils` folder contains utility functions, such as `localStorage.js`, used for interacting with the client-side database.
- The `App.js` file acts as the entry point for the application, defining the routing and rendering of different pages.
- The `index.js` file renders the root component of the application.
- The `index.css` file contains custom styles for the application.

Feel free to explore the code to understand the implementation details of each component and page.
